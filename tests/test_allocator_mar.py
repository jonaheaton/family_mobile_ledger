"""
Allocator tests for the **March 2025** bill with line transfer complexity.

March 2025 presents a unique line transfer scenario:
- Top-level: "11 VOICE LINES = $260.00"
- Reality: Only 10 lines are billable (line 2409883906 is "Old number" with null Plans)
- System should detect this, warn user, and allocate based on 10 billable lines

This validates that the enhanced bill parser and allocator correctly handle
line transfer edge cases without allocation mismatches.
